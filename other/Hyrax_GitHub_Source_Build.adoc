Hyrax GitHub Source Build
-------------------------

From OPeNDAP Documentation

link:../index.php/Developer_Info[<< back to Developer Info]

This describes how to get and build Hyrax from our GitHub repositories.
Hyrax is a data server that implements the DAP2 and DAP4 protocols,
works with a number of different data formats and supports a wide
variety of customization options from tailoring the look of the server's
web pages to complex server-side processing operations. This page
describes how to build the server's source code. If you're working on a
Linux or OS/X computer, the process is similar so we describe only the
linux case; we do not support building the server on Windows operating
systems.

To build and install the server, you need to perform three steps:

1.  Set up the computer to build source code (Install a Java compiler;
install a C/C++ compiler; add some other tools)
2.  Build, install the software. It installs with a default
configuration that includes sample data.
3.  You may need to configure the server for your data

1 A GitHub semi-automatic build
-------------------------------

Use git to clone the https://github.com/opendap/hyrax[hyrax] project and
follow the short instructions in the README file. Summarized here, those
instructions are described in the following two sections. For this to
work you will need a Linux/OSX/Unix computer that is 'set up for
software development.' In practice, OSX 10 with the developer tools or
CentOS 6 meet these requirements. Our C++ software uses _bison_ 3.x, but
we provide that in the _hyrax-dependencies_ repo which is built by the
scripts enumerated below.

1.1 Build Hyrax Using Bash Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This should work for a correctly configured CentOS 6 computer. However,
if it does not work proceed to the manual build. In fact, these scripts
_hyrax_clone.sh_ and _hyrax_build.sh_ simply automate the handful of
commands you need to build the code 'by-hand'.

use bash::
  The shell scripts in this repo assume you are using __bash__.
set up some environment variables so the server will build an install
locally, something that streamlines development::
  _source spath.sh_
clone the three code repos for the server plus the hyrax dependencies::
  _./hyrax_clone.sh -v_
build the code, including the dependencies (note that this repo includes
CMake and Bison 3)::
  _./hyrax_build.sh -v_
test the server::
  Start the BES using _besctl start_
  +
  Start the OLFS using__./build/apache-tomcat-7.0.57/bin/startup.sh__
  +
  Test the server by loooking at _http://localhost:8080/opendap_ in a
  browser. You should see a directory named _data_ and following that
  link should lead to more data. The server will be accessible to
  clients other than a web browser.
  +
  To test the BES function independently of the front end, use
  _bescmdln_ and give it the _show version;_ command, you should see
  output about different components and their versions.
  +
  Use _exit_ to leave the command line test client.

2 GitHub Manual build
---------------------

In the following, we describe only the build process for CentOS; the one
for OS/X is similar and we note the differences where they are
significant. We assume you are starting with a 'bare' machine, i.e., one
not set up for software development. OSX builders will have to
extrapolate from the CentOS commands.

2.1 Make a Place to Build the Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to make a new directory to build the server and set the
environment variable _prefix_ to be that directory name. Then export
_$prefix_ and add _$prefix/bin_ to __$PATH__. I'll use _hyrax-git_ for
the new directory and assume you're using bash.

mkdir hyrax

cd hyrax

export prefix=`pwd`

export PATH=$prefix/bin:$PATH

2.2 Set up a CentOS machine to build code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that I don't like clicking around to different pages to follow
simple directions, so what follows is a short version of the ContOS 6
configuration information we've compiled for people that help us by
building RPM packages for Hyrax. The complete instructions are in
link:../index.php/ConfigureCentos[Configure CentOS] and describe how to
to set up a CentOS 6 machine to build software. What follows is the
condensed version:

Load a basic software development environment::
  _yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel ant git
  gcc-c++ flex bison openssl-devel libuuid-devel readline-devel
  zlib-devel libjpeg-devel libxml2-devel curl-devel cppunit-devel
  rpm-devel rpm-build emacs_
Check the version of bison::
  Use _bison --version_ to see the version of bison. If it is less than
  3.0, get and build the http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/[bison 3.x
  source]. Make sure to update _PATH_ so the build will use the new
  version of bison. The flex from yum should be OK.

2.2.1 Choice point:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You either need to get and build the Hyrax dependencies from source (see
link:#Compile_the_Hyrax_dependencies[Compile the Hyrax dependencies])
_or_ install EPEL for CentOS and then use _yum_ to install the
dependencies, with the caveat that as of Hyrax 1.10, EPEL does not have,
or does not have a recent enough version of GDAL, Gridfields, or
HDF-EOS2 to build our code, so those parts of Hyrax won't build if you
go the EPEL route. Neither way is too hard; building the source takes a
bit longer but results in a more complete server and is required if
you're going to build a binary RPM distribution for the server.

2.2.1.1 Get the Hyrax Dependencies from EPEL
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

EPEL::
  Get
  http://mirror.pnl.gov/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm[epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm]
  and install it using __sudo yum install epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm__.

...Then install packages needed to read various file formats::
  _yum install netcdf-devel hdf-devel hdf5-devel libicu-devel
  cfitsio-devel_

2.2.1.2 Compile the Hyrax dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Note: If you installed packages for netcdf, etc., using EPEL as
described above, skip this step.

Get the hyrax-dependencies _git repo_ and build it. Unlike many source
packages, there is no need to run a configure script, just _make_ will
do. However, the Makefile in this package expects _$prefix_ to be set as
described above. It will put all of the Hyrax server dependencies in a
subdirectory called __$prefix/deps__.

(make sure you're in the directory set to __$prefix__) +
git clone https://github.com/opendap/hyrax-dependencies +
cd hyrax-dependencies +
make --jobs=9::
  The --jobs=N runs a parallel build with at most N simultaneous compile
  operations. This will result in a huge performance improvement on
  multi-core machines. _-jN_ is the short form for the option.
cd ..::
  Go back up to _$prefix_
Add _$prefix/deps/bin_ to _PATH_::
  export PATH=$prefix/deps/bin:$PATH
On Linux _export LD_LIBRARY_FLAGS=$prefix/deps/libs_::
  You will need to set the environment variable _LD_LIBRARY_FLAGS_ to
  reference the directory where the dependencies package stored shared
  libraries or the NcML handler will not find the library. This
  environment variable needs to be defined in the shell used to start
  the server. For OS/X, skip this step.

2.3 Build _libdap_ and the Hyrax _BES_ daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.3.1 Get and build libdap4
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Build, test and install libdap4 into $prefix:

git clone https://github.com/opendap/libdap4 +
cd libdap4 +
autoreconf --force --install --verbose +
./configure --prefix=$prefix --enable-developer +
make -j9 +
make check -j9 +
make install +
cd ..::
  Go back up to _$prefix_

2.3.2 Get and build the BES and all of the modules shipped with Hyrax
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Build, test and install the BES and its modules

git clone https://github.com/opendap/bes::
  Clone the BES from GitHub
cd bes +
git submodule update --init::
  This will clone each of the N modules into the directory __modules__.
  If you _don't_ want to clone all of the modules, skip this step and
  see the note for the next step. See
  http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule[git submodule] for information
  about all you can do with git's submodule command. Also note that this
  does not checkout a particular branch for the submodules; the modules
  are left in the 'detached head' state. To checkout a particular branch
  like 'master', which is important if you'll be making changes to that
  code, use _git submodule foreach 'git checkout master'_ .
git submodule foreach 'git checkout master'::
  This will get all of the modules (which are "headless" images of the
  master branch) correctly associated with the github master branch.
ln -s configure_modules.ac configure.ac::
  This is the one non-standard operation in the clone, configure and
  build of the BES. If you don't want to build the modules, you would
  use _ln -s configure_standard.ac configure.ac_ instead (and not clone
  the modules in the step above)
autoreconf --force --install --verbose::
  You can use -fiv instead of the long options. These mean, when
  starting from a freshly cloned repo, run all of the autotools commands
  and install all of the needed scripts.
./configure --prefix=$prefix --enable-developer
--with-dependencies=$prefix/deps::
  Note that the --with-deps... is not needed if you load the
  dependencies from RPMs or otherwise have them installed an generally
  accessible on the build machine.
make -j9 +
make check -k::
  Some tests may fail and _-k_ ignores that and keeps make marching
  along. We are not using _--j9_ as we did with libdap because some of
  the BES tests fail when run from a parallel build.
make install +
cd ..::
  Go back up to _$prefix_

2.3.3 Test the BES
++++++++++++++++++

Start the BES and verify that all of the modules build correctly.

besctl start::
  Start the BES. Given that _$prefix/bin_ is on your __$PATH__, this
  should start the BES. You will not need to be root if you used the
  _--enable-developer_ switch with configure (as shown above), otherwise
  you should run _sudo besctl start_ with the caveat that as root
  _$prefix/bin_ will probably not be n your __$PATH__.
  +
  If there's an error (e.g., you tried to start as a regular user but
  need to be root), edit bes.conf to be a real user (yourself?) in a
  real group (use 'groups' to see which groups you are in) and also
  check that the bes.log file is _not_ owned by root.
  +
  Restart.
bescmdln::
  Now that the BES is running, start the BES testing tool
show version;::
  Send the BES the version command to see if it's running
  +
  Take a quick look at the output. There should be entries for libdap,
  bes and all of the modules.
exit::
  Exit the testing tool

Note that even though you have exited the _bescmdln_ test tool, the BES
is still running. That's fine - we'll use it in just a bit - but if you
want to shut it down, use __besctl stop__, or _besctl pids_ to see the
daemon's processes. If the BES is not stopping, _besctl kill_ will stop
all BES processes without waiting for them to complete their current
task.

2.4 Build the Hyrax OLFS web application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OLFS is a java servlet built using ant. The OLFS is a java servlet
web application and runs with Tomcat, Glassfish, etc. You need a copy of
Tomcat, but our servlet does not work with the RPM version of Tomcat.
Get http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi[Tomcat 7 from Apache]. Note
that if you built the dependencies from source using the
_hyrac-dependencies-1.10.tar_ then there is a copy of Tomcat in the
_hyrax-dependecies/extra_downloads directory. You can unpack the Tomcat
tar file in_ $prefix__. I'll assume you have the Apache Tomcat tar file
in__ $prefix__.__

tar -xzf apache-tomcat-7.0.57.tar.gz::
  Expand the Tomcat tar ball
git clone https://github.com/opendap/olfs::
  Get the OLFS source code
cd olfs::
  change directory to the OLFS source
ant server::
  Build it
cp build/dist/opendap.war ../apache-tomcat-7.0.57/webapps/::
  Copy the opendap web archive to the tomcat webapps direcotry.
cd ..::
  Go up to _$prefix_
./apache-tomcat-7.0.57/bin/startup.sh::
  Start Tomcat

2.5 Test the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can test the server several ways, but the most fun is to use a web
browser. The URL _http://<machine>:8080/opendap_ should return a page
pointing to a collection of test datasets bundled with the server. You
can also use __curl__, _wget_ or any application that can read from
OpenDAP servers (e.g., Matlab, Octave, ArcGIS, IDL, ...).

2.6 Stopping the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop both the BES and Apache

besctl stop

./apache-tomcat-7.0.57/bin/shutdown.sh

Note that there is also a _hyraxctl_ script that provides a way to start
and stop Hyrax without you (or __init.d__) having to type separate
commands for both the BES and OLFS. This script is part of the BES
software you cloned from git.

2.7 Building select parts of the BES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building just the BES and one of more of its handlers/modules is not at
all hard to do with a checkout of code from git. In the above section on
building the BES, simply skip the step where the submodules are cloned
(__git submodule update --init__) and link configure.ac to
__configure_standard.ac__. The rest of the process is as shown. The end
result is a BES daemon without any of the standard Hyrax modules (but
support for DAP will be built if _libdap_ is found by the configure
script).

To build modules for the BES, simply go to __$prefix__, clone their git
repo and build them, taking care to pass set _$prefix_ when calling the
module's _configure_ script.

Note that it is easy to combine the 'build it all' and 'build just one'
processes so that a complete Hyrax BES can be built in one go and then a
new module/handler not included in the BES git repo can be built and
used. Each module we have on GitHub has a __configure.ac__,
__Makefile.am__, etc., that will support both kinds of builds and
link:../index.php/Configuration_of_BES_Modules[Configuration of BES
Modules] explains how to take a module/handler that builds as a
standalone module and tweak the build scripts so that it's fully
integrated into the Hyrax BES build, too.
