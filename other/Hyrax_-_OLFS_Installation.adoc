Hyrax - OLFS Installation
-------------------------

From OPeNDAP Documentation

*The OLFS comes with a default configuration that is compatible with the
default configuration of the BES. If you do a default install of each
one you should get a running Hyrax server that will be pre-populated
with test data suitable for running the integrity tests.*

-------------------------------------------------------------

2 Download
----------

If you haven't already got it, go
http://www.opendap.org/download/olfs.html[get the latest OLFS
distribution from here]. You should get the binary jar file which will
be named something like: _*olfs-x.x.x-webapp.tgz*_

3 Unpack
--------

Unpack the jar file with the command:

------------------------------
tar -xvf olfs-x.x.x-webapp.tgz
------------------------------

which will unpack a directory called olfs-x.x.x-webapp

4 Install
---------

Inside the that directory find the opendap.war file, and copy it into
the Tomcat's webapps directory:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
cp olfs-x.x.x-webapp/opendap.war /usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.x.x/webapps/
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Assuming the your Tomcat server is in /usr/local)

If you're replacing an older version of the OLFS you may:

* Need to remove the directory `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap` before
restarting Tomcat.
* Discover that some of the existing configuration information for the
OLFS may need to be updated. If after you start Tomcat things don't work
you should compare the `$CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/olfs.xml` file
that contains your exisiting configuration to the new default
configuration located in
`$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/intitalContent/olfs.xml` Look at the
lists of DispatchHandlers and adjust your configuration to use the same
ones.

5 Setup Tomcat
--------------

Configure the Tomcat environment by setting the environment variable
CATALINA_HOME to the full path for the Tomcat distribution.

In bash:

-----------------------------------------------------
export CATALINA_HOME = /usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.x.x
-----------------------------------------------------

6 Start Tomcat
--------------

In the top level tomcat directory (apache-tomcat-6.x.x on my machine)
issue the command:

-----------------------------------------
bin/startup.sh; tail -f logs/catalina.out
-----------------------------------------

Wait a few seconds while it all starts up.

When Tomcat starts up it will unpack your '__OLFS__ and install the
webapp.

 +
 **Usage Note**: If you use _ctrl-c_ to stop watching the tail of the
servers output, make sure to run the command:

---------------
bin/shutdown.sh
---------------

to shutdown Tomcat. If you don't, you may get errors when you next try
to start the Tomcat server.
