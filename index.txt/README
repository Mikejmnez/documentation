Quick note about ceverting to CommonMark Markdown from AsciiDoc.
(NB: We can use HTML, so this is likely not needed, but it's described
here all the same.)

While AsciiDoc is better than CommonMark, the latter is what is
actaully being used by NASA for the developer portal (well, it's one
of the formats, but CM is closest to AsciiDoc).

To convert to CM from adoc, use 'asciidoctor' and 'pandoc' like this:

    asciidoctor -b docbook5 -o quick_start_hack QuickStart.adoc
    pandoc -f docbook -t commonmark -o quick_start.cm quick_start_hack

Or just feed the HTML5 output from asciidoctor into the portal.
