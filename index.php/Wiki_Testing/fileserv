<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="File_Servers"><span class="mw-headline-number">1</span> File Servers</span></h1>
<p>The DODS and OPenDAP projects have used the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler to present a catalog of data files to the world as a single dataset. In many ways this was a very successful system, providing catalogs for multi-granule
datasets that could be searched by date and time. However, the OPeNDAP
project has decided (winter 2006) to adopt the THREDDS xml-based
catalog system developed at Unidata, Inc. The remainder of this
chapter describes the 'file servers' that can be built using the
FreeForm data handler. Even though we feel it's best to adopt the
THREDDS catalogs, there are good reasons to keep existing catalog
servers running and to build new catalogs as a stop-gap measure to
support existing client software. 
</p><p>Normally, in the OPeNDAP
argot, a "dataset" is contained in a single file on a disk. However,
this paradigm is often broken by large datasets that may contain many
thousands or tens of thousands of data files. The OPeNDAP file server is
a way to make these dicrete datasets appear to be a single large
dataset.
</p><p>The OPeNDAP file server is an OPeNDAP server that returns a URL or set of
URLs in response to a query containing selection variables.  For
example, a dataset organized by date and geographic location might
provide a file server that allowed you to query the dataset with a
range of dates and longitudes.  This fileserver would return a list of
one or more URLs corresponding to files within that dataset that fell
within the given range.
</p><p><br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Problem"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.1</span> The Problem</span></h2>
<p>Consider the following (imaginary) list of files:
</p>
<pre>
1997360.nc  1998001.nc  1998007.nc  1998013.nc ...
1997361.nc  1998002.nc  1998008.nc  1998014.nc
1997362.nc  1998003.nc  1998009.nc  1998015.nc
1997363.nc  1998004.nc  1998010.nc  1998016.nc
1997364.nc  1998005.nc  1998011.nc  1998017.nc
1997365.nc  1998006.nc  1998012.nc  1998018.nc
</pre>
<p>These appear to be a set of netCDF files, arranged by
date<a href="../index.php/Wiki_Testing/footnotes" title="Wiki Testing/footnotes">(3)</a>
</p><p>If you want data from the first week of January, 1998, it is fairly
clear which files to request.  However, the OPeNDAP server provides
no way to request data from more than one file, so your request would
have to be split into 7 different requests, from <font color="green">1998001.nc</font> to
<font color="green">1998007.nc</font>.  This could be represented as a set of seven DODS
URLs: 
</p>
<pre>
http://opendap/dap/data/1998001.nc
http://opendap/dap/data/1998002.nc
http://opendap/dap/data/1998003.nc
http://opendap/dap/data/1998004.nc
http://opendap/dap/data/1998005.nc
http://opendap/dap/data/1998006.nc
http://opendap/dap/data/1998007.nc
</pre>
<p>But what if you then uncover another similar dataset whose data you
want to compare to the first?  Or what if you want to expand the
inquiry to cover the entire year?  Keeping track of this many URLs
will quickly become burdensome.
</p><p>What's more, another similar dataset could be arranged in two
different directories, <font color="green">1997</font> and <font color="green">1998</font>, each with files:
</p>
<pre>
001.nc
002.nc
003.nc
...
</pre>
<p>and so on.  Now you have to keep track of two large sets of URLs, in
two different forms.  But you could also imagine files called:
</p>
<pre>
0011998.nc
0021998.nc
0031998.nc
</pre>
<p>or
</p>
<pre>
00198.nc
00298.nc
00398.nc
</pre>
<p>or
</p>
<pre>
1Jan98.nc
2Jan98.nc
3Jan98.nc
</pre>
<p>That is, the number of possible sensible arrangements may not, in
fact, be infinite, but it may seem that way to a scientist who is
simply trying to find data.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_OPeNDAP_File_Server_Solution"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.2</span> The OPeNDAP File Server Solution</span></h2>
<p>To create a system that allows data providers to assert a degree of
uniformity over wildly variable dataset organizations, OPeNDAP
provides for the installation of an OPeNDAP \new{file server}. The
file server is a server that provides access to a special dataset,
containing associations between the names of files within a dataset
and some "selectable" data values.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Selectable_Data"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.2.1</span> Selectable Data</span></h3>
<p>The concept of \new{selectable data} requires some explanation.  This
is used to indicate the data variables you might ordinarily use to
narrow your search for data in the first pass at a dataset.
</p><p>For geophysical data, the selectable data is often the time and
location of the data, since typical searches for data often begin by
specifying a part of the globe that bears examining, or a date of some
event.  For other types of data, other data variables will seem more
appropriate.  Model data, for example, which has no real location or
time, might be arranged by the parameters that varied between runs.
</p><p>A comprehensive definition of selectable data has so far eluded the
OPeNDAP group, but there are some guidelines, albeit fairly vague ones:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The selectable data is generally <i>not</i>  recorded within each data file.  However, the selectable data may often include a <i>range</i>  summarizing some of the data within each file.
</li>
<li>The selectable data should help a user decide whether a particular data file in a dataset is useful.  A temperature range might not be as useful as a time range, since data searches more often start with time.  (Both would presumably be still more useful,but there is a trade-off between the utility of the file server and
</li>
</ul>
<p>the time spent maintaining it.)
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_It_Looks_Like"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.2.2</span> What It Looks Like</span></h3>
<p>Consider again the set of data files shown in (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www"><cite> fs,problem</cite></a>).
We could associate each one of these files with a date, and this would
provide the rudiments of a file server if we then serve that data with
an OPeNDAP server such as the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler .

<p>This list represents a set of DAP URLs, each identified by a date,
given as a year and a serial day.  The files appear to be netCDF
format files, served by an OPeNDAP netCDF server, but that is not
important for this discussion.
</p><p>To use the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler for your file server, you could use a format
description file with an input section like this:
</p>
<pre>
ASCII_input_data &quot;File Server Example Input&quot;
year 1 4 short 0
serial_day 6 8 short 0
DODS_Url 10 46 char 0
