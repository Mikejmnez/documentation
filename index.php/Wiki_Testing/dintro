<p>The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler is an OPeNDAP data handler
OPeNDAP FreeForm ND software to serve data from files in almost any format. The
FreeForm ND Data Access System is a flexible system for specifying
data formats to facilitate data access, management, and use. Since
DAP2 allows data to be translated over the internet and read by a
client regardless of the storage format of the data, the combination
allows several format restrictions to be overcome. 
</p><p>The large variety of data formats is a primary obstacle in the way of
creating flexible data management and analysis software. FreeForm ND
was conceived, developed, and implemented at the National Geophysical
Data Center (NGDC) to alleviate the problems that occur when you need
to use data sets with varying native formats or to write
format-independent applications.
</p><p>DAP2 was originally conceived as a way to move large amounts of
scientific data over the internet.  As a consequence of establishing a
flexible data transmission format, DAP2 also allows substantial
independence from the storage format of the original data.  Up to now,
however, DAP2 servers have been limited to data in a few widely used
formats.  Using the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler , many more datasets can be made available
through DAP2.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_FreeForm_ND_Solution"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.1</span> The FreeForm ND Solution</span></h2>
<p>OPeNDAP FreeForm ND uses a <i>format descriptor</i> file to describe the format
of one or more data files.  This descriptor file is a simple text file
that can be created with a text editor, describing the structure of
your data files.
</p><p>A traditional DAP2 server, illustrated <a href="../index.php/File:Regular.jpg" title="File:Regular.jpg">below</a> 
receives a request for data from a DAP2 client who may be at some
remote computer<a href="../index.php/Wiki_Testing/footnotes" title="Wiki Testing/footnotes">(2)</a>. The data served by this server must be stored in one of the data formats supported by the OPeNDAP server (such as netCDF, HDF, or JGOFS), and the server uses specialized software to read this data
from disk.
</p><p>When it receives a request, the server reads the requested data from
its archive, reformats the data into the DAP2 transmission format and
sends the data back to the client.

</p>

<p>The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler works in a similar fashion to a traditional DAP2 server, but
before the server reads the data from the archive, it first reads the
data format descriptor to determine how it should read the data.  Only
after it has absorbed the details of the data storage format does it
attempt to read the data, pack it into the transmission format and
send it on its way back to the client.

<p>The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler comprises a format description mechanism, a set of programs
for manipulating data, and the server itself.  The software was built
using the FreeForm ND library and data objects.  These are documented
in The FreeForm ND User's Guide.
</p><p>The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler includes the following programs:
</p><p><br /> 
</p>
<dl>
<dt> <font color="green">dap_ff_handler</font>&#160;</dt>
<dd> The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler <i>data handler</i>. This program is run by the OPeNDAP server to handle the parts of any requests that require knowledge specifically about FreeForm. This program is run by the main server 'dispatch' software. That software is described in the Server Installation Guide, available on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.opendap.org/"><cite>OPeNDAP Home Page</cite></a> .
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
The OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler distribution also includes the following OPeNDAP FreeForm ND utilities. These are quite useful to write and debug format description files.
</p><p><br /> 
</p>
<dl>
<dt> <font color="green">newform</font>&#160;</dt>
<dd> This program reformats data according to the input <i>and output</i>  specifications in a format description file.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt> <font color="green">chkform</font>&#160;</dt>
<dd> After writing a format description file, you can use this program to cross-check the description against a data file.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt> <font color="green">readfile</font>&#160;</dt>
<dd> This program is useful to decode the format used by a binary file.  It allows you to try different formats on pieces of a binary file, and see what works.

<p>If you don't have the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler , and want it, follow these directions.  If you have a copy of the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler , and want to know how to use it, see (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www"><cite> ff,dquick</cite></a>) for quick instructions and examples of its use, and <a href="../index.php/Wiki_Testing/ff-server" title="Wiki Testing/ff-server"> Chapter 6</a> for further information.
</p><p>You can get the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.opendap.org/"><cite>OPeNDAP</cite></a> . Follow the links to
"Download Software" and then to "Current Release."  If your
computer is one of the platforms for which we provide a binary release,
get that, otherwise get the source code.
</p><p>To get a binary release, go to that page, click on the computer you
use, and click on the "FreeForm" button in the "Servers" box.
Click the Download button, and follow the directions.  The
server will make a custom binary file for you, which you then
download.
</p><p>Install the resulting shared library in a place where <a href="../index.php/Hyrax" title="Hyrax">Hyrax</a> can
find it, and then consult the Hyrax configuration instructions for the
remaining configuration steps.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Compiling_the_OPeNDAP_FreeForm_ND_Data_Handler"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.3.1</span> Compiling the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler</span></h4>
<p>If the computer and operating system combination you use is not one of
the ones we own, you will have to compile the OPeNDAP FreeForm ND Data Handler from its source. Go to the OPeNDAP home page (www.opendap.org) and follow the menu item
to the downloads page. From there you will need the libdap, dap-server
and FreeForm handler software source distributions. Get each of these
and perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand the distribution (e.g., tar -xzf libdap-3.5.3.tar.gz)
</li>
<li>Change to the newly created directory (<font color="green">cd libdap-3.5.3</font>)
</li>
<li>Run the configure script (<font color="green">./configure</font>)
</li>
<li>Run make (<font color="green">make</font>)
</li>
<li>Install the software (<font color="green">make install</font> or sudo make install)
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each source distribution contains more detailed build instructions;
see the <font color="green">README</font>, <font color="green">INSTALL</font> and <font color="green">NEWS</font> files for the most
up-to-date information.
