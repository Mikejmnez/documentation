<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Questions_and_Assumptions"><span class="mw-headline-number">1</span> General Questions and Assumptions</span></h2>
<ul>
<li> What version of netCDF will this support? 
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 11:39, 21 December 2008 (PST) Initially we should support netCDF version 3
</p>
<ul>
<li> Should I traverse the data structure to see if there are any sequences?
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 17:53, 18 December 2008 (PST) Yes. An initial version should note their presence and add an attribute noting that they have been elided.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_flatten_hierarchical_types"><span class="mw-headline-number">2</span> How to flatten hierarchical types</span></h2>
<p>For a structure such as
</p>
<pre>Structure {
    Int x;
    Int y;
} Point;
</pre>
<p>represent that as
</p>
<pre>Point.x
Point.y
</pre>
<p>Explicitly including the dot seems ugly and like a kludge and so on, but it means that the new variable name can be feed back into the server to get the data. That is, a client can look at the name of the variable and figure out how to ask for it again without knowing anything about the translation process.
</p><p>Because this is hardly a lossless scheme (a variable might have a dot in its name...), we should also add an attribute that contains the original real name of the variable - information that this is the result of a flattening operation, that the parent variable was a Structure, Sequence or Grid and its name was <i>xyz</i>. Given that, it should be easy to sort out how to make a future request for the data in the translated variable. 
</p><p>This in some way obviates the need for the dot, but I think we should use that regardless.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Attributes_of_flattened_types.2Fvariables"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.1</span> Attributes of flattened types/variables</span></h3>
<p>If the structure <i>Point</i> has attributes, those should be copied to both the new variables (<i>Point.x</i> and <i>Point.y</i>). It's redundant but this way the recipient of the file gets all of the information held in the original data source. <a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 10:14, 6 January 2009 (PST) Added based on email from Patrick.
</p><p>The name of the attributes should be Point.name for any attributes of the structure Point, and just the name of the attribute for the variables x and y. So, if x has attributes a1 and a2 and Point has attributes a1 and a3 then the new variable Point.x will have attributes a1, a2, Point,a1 and Point.a3.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Extra_data_to_be_included"><span class="mw-headline-number">3</span> Extra data to be included</span></h2>
<p>For a file format like netCDF it is possible to include data about the source data using it's original data model as expressed using DAP. We could then describe where each variable in the file came from. This would be a good thing if we can do it in a light-weight way. I think it would also be a good thing to add an attribute to each variable that names where in the original data it came from so that client apps &amp; users don't have to work too hard to sort out what has been changed to make the file.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Information_About_Specific_Types"><span class="mw-headline-number">4</span> Information About Specific Types</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Strings"><span class="mw-headline-number">4.1</span> Strings</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> Add dimension representing the max length of the string with name varname_len.
</li>
<li> For scalar there will be a dimension for the length and the value written using nc_put_vara_text with type NC_CHAR
</li>
<li> For arrays add an additional dimension for the max length and the value written using nc_put_vara_text with type NC_CHAR
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../index.php/User:Pwest" title="User:Pwest">pwest</a> 14:31, 7 January 2008 (MST) Received message from Russ Rew
</p><p>Yes, that's fine and follows a loose convention for names of string-length
dimensions for netCDF-3 character arrays.
</p><p>For netCDF-4 of course, no string-length dimension is needed, as strings
are supported as a netCDF data type.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Structures"><span class="mw-headline-number">4.2</span> Structures</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> Flatten
</li>
<li> prepend name of structure with a dot followed by the variable name. Keep track as there might be embedded structures, grids, etc...
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 17:53, 18 December 2008 (PST) Use the procedure described above in <i>How to flatten hierarchical types</i>.
</p><p><a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 17:53, 18 December 2008 (PST) I would use a dot even though I know that dots in variable names are, in general, a bad idea. If we use underscores then it maybe hard for clients to form a name that can be used to access values from a server based on the information in the file. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grid"><span class="mw-headline-number">4.3</span> Grid</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> Flatten.
</li>
<li> Use the name of the grid for the array of values
</li>
<li> prepend the name of the grid plus a dot to the names of each of the map vectors. <a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 11:31, 21 December 2008 (PST) A more sophisticated version might look at the values of two or more grids that use the same names and have the same type (e.g., Float64 lon[360]) and if they are the same, make them shared dimensions.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read:

<ul>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/guidec/guidec-7.html">netcdf guide on components</a>
</li>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://opendap.org/pdf/ESE-RFC-004v1.1.pdf">DAP 2 spec</a> on Grids and look for naming conventions
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea here is that each of the map vectors will become an array with one dimension, the name of the dimension the same as the name of the variable (be careful about nested maps, see flatten). Then the grid array of values uses the same dimensions as those used in the map variables.
</p><p>If there are multiple grids then they either use the same map variables and dimensions or they use different variables with different dimensions. In other words, if one grid has a map called x with dimension x, and another grid has a map called x then it better be the same variable with the same dimension and values. If not, it's an error, it should be using a map called y that gets written out as variable y with dimension y.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Read the dap spec on grids and see if this is the convention.
</li>
<li> Read the netcdf component guide (section 2.2.1 and 2.3.1)
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example files:
</p>
<ul>
<li> coads_climatology.nc (4 grids, same maps and dimensions)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
</p>
<pre>Dataset {
    Grid {
      Array:
        Float32 X[TIME = 12][COADSY = 90][COADSX = 180];
      Maps:
        Float64 TIME[TIME = 12];
        Float64 COADSY[COADSY = 90];
        Float64 COADSX[COADSX = 180];
    } X;
    Grid {
      Array:
        Float32 Y[TIME = 12][COADSY = 90][COADSX = 180];
      Maps:
        Float64 TIME[TIME = 12];
        Float64 COADSY[COADSY = 90];
        Float64 COADSX[COADSX = 180];
    } Y;
    Grid {
      Array:
        Float32 Z[TIME = 14][COADSY = 75][COADSX = 75];
      Maps:
        Float64 TIME[TIME = 14];
        Float64 COADSY[COADSY = 75];
        Float64 COADSX[COADSX = 75];
    } Z;
    Grid {
      Array:
        Float32 T[TIME = 14][COADSY = 75][COADSX = 90];
      Maps:
        Float64 TIME[TIME = 14];
        Float64 COADSY[COADSY = 75];
        Float64 COADSX[COADSX = 90];
    } T;
} coads_climatology.nc;
</pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Array"><span class="mw-headline-number">4.4</span> Array</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> write_array appears to be working just fine.
</li>
<li> If array of complex types?
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../index.php/User:Pwest" title="User:Pwest">pwest</a> 16:43, 8 January 2008 (MST) - DAP allows for the array dimensions to not have names, but NetCDF does not allow this. If the dimension name is empty then create the dimension name using the name of the variable + "_dim" + dim_num. So, for example, if array a has three dimensions, and none have names, then the names will be a_dim1, a_dim2, a_dim3.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sequences"><span class="mw-headline-number">4.5</span> Sequences</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> For now throw an exception <a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 11:31, 21 December 2008 (PST) Initial version should elide these I think because there are important cases where they appear as part of a dataset but not the main part. We can represent these as arrays easily in the future.
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 11:39, 21 December 2008 (PST) To translate a Sequence, there are several cases to consider:
</p>
<ol>
<li> A Sequence of simple types only (which means a one-level sequence): translate to a set of arrays using a name-prefix flattening scheme.
</li>
<li> A nested sequence (otherwise with only simple types) should first be flattened to a one level sequence and then that should be flattened.
</li>
<li> A Sequence with a Structure or Grid should be flattened by recursively applying the flattening logic to the components. 
</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Attributes"><span class="mw-headline-number">4.6</span> Attributes</span></h3>
<ul>
<li> Global Attributes?
<ul>
<li> For single container DDS (no embedded structure) just write out the global attributes to the netcdf file
</li>
<li> For multi-container DDS (multiple files each in an embedded Structure), take the global attributes from each of the containers and add them as global attributes to the target netcdf file. If the value already exists for the attribute then discard the value. If not then add the value to the attribute as attributes can have multiple values.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Variable Attributes
<ul>
<li> This is the way attributes should be stored in the DAS. In the entry class/structure there is a vector of strings. Each of these strings should contain one value for the attribute. If the attribute is a list of 10 int values then there will be 10 strings in the vector, each string representing one of the int values for the attribute.
</li>
<li> What about attributes for structures? Should these attributes be created for each of the variables in the structure? So, if there is a structure Point with variables x and y then the attributes for a will be attributes for Point.x and Point.y? Or are there attributes for each of the variables in the structure? Or both. <a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 10:13, 6 January 2009 (PST) See above under the information about hierarchical types.
</li>
<li> For multi-dimensional datasets there will be a structure for each container, and each of these containers will have global attributes. <a href="../index.php/User:Jimg" title="User:Jimg">jimg</a> 10:13, 6 January 2009 (PST) I don't understand this statement.
</li>
<li> Attribute containers should be treated just as structures. The attributes will be flattened with dot separation of the names. For example, if there is an attribute a that is a container of attributes with attributes b and c then we will create an attribute a.b and a.c for that variable.
</li>
<li> Attributes with multiple string values will be handled like so. The individual values will be put together with a newline character at the end of each, making one single value.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Added_attributes"><span class="mw-headline-number">4.7</span> Added attributes</span></h3>
<p><a href="../index.php/User:Pwest" title="User:Pwest">pwest</a> 14 January, 2009 - This feature will not be added as part of 1.5, but a future release.
</p><p>After doing some kind of translation, whether with constraints, aggregation, file out, whatever, we need to add information to the resulting data product telling how we came about this result. Version of the software, version of the translation (file out), version of the aggregation engine, whatever. How do we do that?
</p><p>The ideas might be not to have all of this information in, say, the GLOBAL attributes section of the data product, or in the attributes of the opendap data product (DDX, DataDDX, whatever) but instead a URI pointing to this information. Perhaps this information is stored at OPeNDAP, provenance information for the different software components. Perhaps the provenance information for this data product is stored locally, referenced in the data product, and this provenance information references software component provenance.
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.opendap.org/provenance?id=xxxxxx">http://www.opendap.org/provenance?id=xxxxxx</a>
</p><p>might be something referenced in the local provenance. The local provenance would keep track of:
</p>
<ul>
<li> containers used to generate the data product
</li>
<li> constraints (server side functions, projections, etc...)
</li>
<li> aggregation handler and command
</li>
<li> data product requested
</li>
<li> software component versions
</li>
</ul>
<p>Peter Fox mentions that we need to be careful of this sort of thing (storing provenance information locally) as this was tried with log information. Referencing this kind of information is dangerous.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Support_for_CF"><span class="mw-headline-number">5</span> Support for CF</span></h2>
<p>If we can recognize and support files that contain CF-compliant information, we should strive to make sure that the resulting netCDF files built by this module from those files are also CF compliant. This will have a number of benefits, most of which are likely unknown right now because acceptance of CF is not complete. But one example is that ArcGIS understands CF, so that means that returning a netCDF file that follows CF provides a way to get information from our servers directly into this application without any modification to the app itself. 
</p><p>Here's a link to information about CF: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.4/cf-conventions.html#appendix-grid-mappings">Grid Mappings</a>.
