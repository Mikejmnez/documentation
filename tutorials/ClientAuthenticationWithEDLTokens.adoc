== Overview
Using EDL tokens for authentication is usually straight forward when the software
making the requests has an API/UI that allows the injection of an HTTP request
header. All the data access clients that we have been tested with EDL
authentication have been working because the EDL authentication endpoints support
the most fundamental type of web authentication, HTTP BASIC.

The introduction of EDL tokens means a move away from the HTTP and into something
new. Some very flexible clients like `cURL` and `wget` can easily adapt to the change
in authentication procedure by simply taking an EDL token and submitting it as
part of an Authorization request header.

Other data access client software has no API or UI through which an EDL token
might be introduced and used in an authorization header.

== Acquire an EDL token from the EDL service
This is an activity that you must do by hand, with a browser.

* Point you browser here: https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile
image:EDL_Profile_Page.png[EDL Profile]

* Click the `Generate Token` link.
* Now you should be at the `Generate a Bearer Token` page

* Click the big green `Generate Token` button.
* Consider the resulting page:

Copy the token into your clipboard and save it in a local file for safe keeping.
Also, for the purposes of this guide, make a file called `edl_token_auth.hdr` and
in the file put this line:
----
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_VALUE
----

== _curl_ (Command line _cURL_)

You can utilize your EDL token with cURL request as follows:
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
export url="https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds"
echo "url: ${url}" >&2

export auth_hdr=$(cat edl_token_auth.hdr)
echo "auth_hdr: ${auth_hdr}" >&2

curl -c ~/edlCookies -b ~/edlCookies -L -H "${auth_hdr}" "${url}"
----

What is happening here?

`-k`:: This tells _cURL_ to accept self-signed certificates. This is ok for
working with trusted (as in your own) "test" services but should be removed
for working with production systems. Because: Security, Chain-Of-Trust, etc.

`-c edlCookies`:: This tells _cURL_ to stash cookies in the file _edlCookies_

`-b edlCookies`:: This tells _cURL_ to read cookies from the file _edlCookies_

`-L`:: This option (aka _--location_) tells _cURL_ to follow redirects, which is a
must for any Single Sign On (SSO) authentication flow, such as OAuth2.

`-H` "${auth_hdr}":: The -H option adds its parameter value as a request header in
the HTTP request sent to the origin server, `${url}` in the example above.

`${url}`:: The URL to dereference and retrieve.

== _wget_

In this example we will also utilize the `edl_token_auth.hdr` file the we
created earlier.

Consider this _wget_ command:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
export url="https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.das"
echo "url: ${url}" >&2

export auth_hdr=$(cat edl_token_auth.hdr)
echo "auth_hdr: ${auth_hdr}" >&2

wget --load-cookies ./cookie_jar --save-cookies ./cookie_jar --keep-session-cookie --header="${auth_hdr}" "${url}"
----
What's happening withb `wget` here?

`--load-cookies cookies` :: Load cookies from the file "./cookie_jar"
`--save-cookies cookies` :: Save cookies to the file "./cookie_jar"
`--keep-session-cookie` :: Save session cookies.
`--header "${auth_hdr}"` :: Send the value of the environment variable `auth_hdr`
along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP request.  The supplied header
is sent as-is, which means it must contain name and value separated by colon,
and must not contain newlines.
`${url}`:: The URL to retrieve, in this case
https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.das


== _PyDAP_

Summary ::
Because PyDAP allows the programmer to inject a Session object with customized
request headers it is pretty straight forward to utilize an EDL token when
making requests.

[source,python]
----
# Importing the star of our show, PyDAP!
import pydap

print ("dataset_url: ", dataset_url)

# This gets the EDL token from the users keyboard.
edl_token=input("EDL Token Value: ")
print("EDL Token: ", edl_token);

auth_hdr="Bearer "+edl_token
print("auth_hdr: ", auth_hdr);

# PyDAP accepts a Session, so we make a Session and give it the Authorization
# header:

my_session = requests.Session()
my_session.headers={"Authorization", auth_hdr}

pd_dataset = pydap.client.open_url(dataset_url, session=my_session, protocol="dap4")

== _ncdump_, _nccopy_, _Matlab_, and other applications that use _NetCDF-C_

Neither of the usage statements from `nccopy` and `ncdump` contain any mention
of submitting arbitrary headers, or authorization headers through their
published command line interface.

We may need to make a request to UNIDATA to add a request header injection UI
to the NetCDF tools because until this is resolved existing NetCDF client will
be able to work with EDL tokens.


== _Panoply_, _ToolsUI_, _Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)_

None of these GUI driven data access clients contain a GUI component that
allows the user to either submit an authorization header or EDL token value.
Nor do they have a mechanism through which a user may identify an authorization
header or token file. Until these applications GUIs or their configuration
interface have been changed to utilize tokens these applications will be unable
to authenticate with EDL without using HTTP BASIC authentication (including an
expected 401 response from the EDL endpoint) and traditional credentials.
