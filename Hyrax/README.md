## About these files

These files are derived from the Hyrax documentation pages on
docs.OPeNDAP.org. I've extracted them from the files in
documentation/other and then grouped them into the files in this
directory and those in the sub-directories _handlers_ and
_aggregation_. The latter two hold information abut specific handlers
and the _aggregation handler_ that are bundled with the server.

The files reference images in the _documentation/images_ directory,
and those links will need to be fixed, one way or another.

I will remove the files from _documentation/other_ that are here, so
there are no duplicates.

The files that start with the prefix Master: Some are composite documents,
others are just one file. 

The files that are prefixed with Hyrax: The original files from the wiki. Some of these are 'included' by the 'Master' documents.
