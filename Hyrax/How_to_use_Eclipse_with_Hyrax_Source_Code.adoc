How to use Eclipse with Hyrax Source Code
-----------------------------------------

From OPeNDAP Documentation

This presents one way to set up Eclipse to build, edit, debug, etc., the
Hyrax source code. It's based on our previous how to documents, but is
updated for (and maybe specific to) OSX 10.10, Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) and
CDT 8.5. There are many things about Eclipse that can be pretty obscure,
not the least of which is that Eclipse & CDT are not really 'just
Eclipse' but may have specific configuration nuances. This is almost
certainly not the _only_ way to set this tool up to build the Hyrax
code, just one way.

The set up assumes that you have already cloned the _hyrax_ repo from
GitHub (https://github.com/opendap/hyrax.git) and have run _source
spath.sh_ and _./hyrax_clone.sh_ so that the $PATH and $prefix
environment variables are set and the __libdap__, _bes_ and _olfs_ repos
have all been cloned. For most development, it's a good idea to clone
_hyrax-dependencies_ too.

1 The _git_ perspective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What I've done to make projects that use the existing C++ code repos
cloned from GitHub was to first use the _git_ perspective to add the
repo to Eclipse.

Switch to the _git_ perspective using either the icon/toll-bar item on
the right side of the main window or by going to the Window -> Open
Perspective menu item.

../index.php/File:Perspective_Menu.png[image:../images/0/06/Perspective_Menu.png[Perspective
views are accessed using either the rightmost set of icons or the Window
menu]]

Once the Eclipse window is showing the _git_ perspective, you'll see
something like the following:

../index.php/File:Git_Repo_Perspective.png[image:../images/f/f9/Git_Repo_Perspective.png[Git
Repo Perspective.png]]

Use the _Add existing git repository_ icon to add an existing _git_
repo.

../index.php/File:Add_Existing_Repo.png[image:../images/c/c3/Add_Existing_Repo.png[Add
Existing Repo.png]]

The result looks like:

../index.php/File:Once_Added.png[image:../images/4/41/Once_Added.png[Once
Added.png]]

2 Make the projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow theses steps to make a new project using the repo you just added
to the _git_ perspective.

* Import Projects
* New Project
* Use the New Project Wizard
* Existing Code Makefile
* Setup the Project
* Switch to C++ Perspective
* The New project

3 General Eclipse configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are not specific to our project, but they are very useful and
somewhat hard to sort out.

* How to set up PATH so the CDT build (which uses an external program)
reads from the PATH you want instead of the default PATH
** ../index.php/File:0_Set_PATH_in_Eclipse.png[image:../images/b/b7/0_Set_PATH_in_Eclipse.png[0

** ../index.php/File:1_Add_the_prefix_var_to_project.png[image:../images/7/7b/1_Add_the_prefix_var_to_project.png[1

** ../index.php/File:2_Set_PATH_in_the_project.png[image:../images/1/11/2_Set_PATH_in_the_project.png[2
Set PATH in the project.png]]
** Do you need to set PATH in both Eclipse and the Project? I don't
know, but that's what I wound up doing to get it to work.
* How to get the editor in CDT to save before building code
** ../index.php/File:0_Set_autosave_on_build.png[image:../images/b/b7/0_Set_autosave_on_build.png[0

* How to configure builds using an existing Makefile

** ../index.php/File:1_configure_new_make_target.png[image:../images/b/b8/1_configure_new_make_target.png[1

* Editor tweaks:
** Emacs mode (it's not a real emacs, but it's bearable)

* GDB on OS/X 10.9 and 10.10 is broken WRT shared object libraries
(i.e., BES modules).
** Build GDB 7.8.x (other versions might work, but the default 6.x that
comes with OS/X won't). To do this I had to _sudo cp
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr/include/machine/setjmp.h
/usr/include/machine/_ because while _setjmp.h_ is present, there's
nothing in <machine/setjmp.h> on 10.10 (and maybe 10.9, too). This may
also explain the _homebrew_ install fail on gdb, but I don't know. I
also used _export CC=gcc_ before running _./configure_ for gdb, but I
doubt that made any difference in hindsight. Regardless, get a modern
GDB built and installed.
** Follow this advice on setup with eclipse:
http://ntraft.com/installing-gdb-on-os-x-mavericks/. NB: since PATH is
already configured to have /usr/local/bin before the other stuff, the
part about setting C/C++ -> Debug -> GDB to /usr/local/bin/gdb may be
moot, but I did it all the same. The example shows the preferences
window from a version of eclipse earlier than 4.4, which I am using.
** GDB and libtool: But GDB won't debug programs built with shared libs
(dylibs on OS/X), responding with this message: _"hell": not in
executable format: File format not recognized_ for the program _hell_
that's linked using libtool. Nice. The work-around is to use _libtool
--mode=execute gdb hell_ and maybe to set GDB to be _libtool
--mode=execute gdb_ although I have not tried the later.
** Here is advice on signing GDB (if you build it from source) so that
OS/X 10.9++ will run it and let it attach to a running process:
https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin
** Now set up Eclipse:
