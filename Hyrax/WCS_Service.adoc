== Overview

Hyrax includes an optional WCS-2 service (spcificlly version 2.0.1)
that can be used to access all of the geo-referenced data available to
the server that meet the requirements of the WCS 2 specification. This
appendix describes the the kinds of data that meet these requirements
along with the configuration process of the bundled WCS service.

== Theory of Operation

The WCS utilizes a DAP server (e.g., Hyrax) to supply both coverage
metadata and binary data in response to WCS client requests. In this
operational model, each DAP dataset is considered a (potential) WCS
coverage and the variables within a dataset are (potential) WCS
coverage Field entities.

The WCS service attempts to dynamically map DAP datasets to WCS
coverages so that the data provider need not learn all of the details
of the WCS specifications. All the data provider will need to provide
is a simple template for each set of related datasets and coverages.
The amount of detail required in a template is a function of the
metadata available within a specific datatset. The template, called a
_DynamicService_ definition, must provide the domain coordinate
details (Latitdue, Longitude, et c.) for a group of coverages and,
depending on available metadata, may also need to provide the
field/variable definitions. The template uses a regular expression to
create the association between the _DynamicService_ definition and
files in the DAP server.

=== WCS Definitions

WARNING: Hack definitions. Look at the OGC abstract documents for a
more comprehensive set of definitions.

Coverage:: A mapping between a _domain_ and a _range_. This might
sound familiar if you remember your first algebra class, because it is
the definition of a function. A _coverage_ is a special case because
the _domain_ is often limited to a specific geographic area defined by
a rnage of latitude and longitude values.

Domain Coordinate:: In a _coverage_, a variable that provides the
values for the coverage's domain. For example, the variable that
provides the latitude values.

Spatial Reference System (SRS):: The SRS's axes define the _domain_ of
the coverage, which are typically latitude and longitude. The SRS also
provides geo-referencing information that enables analysis tools to
account for irregularities in the Earth's geoid. The term _Coordinate
Reference System (CRS)_ is a synomyn for this term.

== WCS Versions Supported

The Open Geospatial Consortium
(link:http://www.opengeospatial.org/[OGC]) has developed the Web
Coverage Service (WCS) as an open specification and there is a suite
of standards documents that describe different aspects of the service.
Hyrax supports several of these standards beyond the basic WCS 2.0
core specification.

TIP: The _Open Geospatial Consortium_ has many documents that describe
the concept of a _coverage_ and the different features of WCS. The
link:http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs[suite of
specifications that describe WCS] can be found on their website.

The WCS service bundled with Hyrax 1.14 supports the following WCS
specifications:

* WCS Core Interface Core, version 2.0.1
* Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS), version 1.0.1
* Range Subsetting, version 1.0.0
* KVP Protocol Binding, version 1.0.1

* GeoTIFF Coverage Encoding Profile, version 1.0.1
* JPEG2000 Coverage Encoding Profile, version 1.0.0
* CF-netCDF 3.0 encoding using GML Coverage Application Schema,
  version 2.0

We have partial implementations for:

* XML/POST protocol Binding Extension, version 1.0.0
* XML/SOAP Protocol Binding Extension, version 1.0.0
* Scaling Extension, version 1.0.0
* CRS Extension, version1.0.0

If you are interested in the _Earth Observation Application Profile_,
version 1.0.0, contact us.

== Candidate Datasets

In order for the WCS service to work with a dataset served using DAP,
that dataset must contain one or more _coverages_. The dataset
variables must meet the WCS requirements for both structure and
metadata. To qualify as a coverage, a variable in a dataset must meet
the following criteria:

* The variable must have an associated _Spatial Reference System_
  (SRS) that describes the organization of latitude and longitude for
  the variable.
  
* The variable must be a numeric array of at least two dimentsions.

* The variable's right-most dimensions must be axes defined by the SRS
  (i.e., longitude and latitude) and they must match the SRS's axis'
  order.

* Other dimensions of the variable must be 'to the left' of the
  dimensions defined by the SRS.

* The _range_ of the coverage is comprised of the values of the
  variable. These values must have an associated _unit of measure_.

* _Describe how variable shape affects whether a variable can be a
  coverage. Or say whatever is correct._

TODO: Fix this list.

NOTE: In practice, Hyrax is often used with data that have global
  extent, which corresponds to the SRS _WGS84_ (aka _EPSG 4396_). The
  current version of the WCS service only supports this SRS.

TIP: We're interested in adding support for WCS 2.1 but would like to
hear from potential users to know there is interest in that before we
commit development resources to it. The standard metadata for WCS 2.0
is limited to representing two-dimensional metadata, so variables in a
dataset with three or more dimensions cannot be completely described
by the _CoverageDescription_ response object because of limitations in
the GML (link:http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml[Geography
Markup Language]). WCS 2.1, on the other hand, uses the 
link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-146r6/09-146r6.html[Coverage
Implementation Schema (CIS) 1.1] standard and is more expressive with respect
to the coverage's domain. Please contact us if you are interested by
sending a note to
link:mailto:support@opendap.org[support@opendap.org].

== WCS Installation

The WCS 2 service comes bundled as part of Hyrax-1.14.0 and newer.
See the link:https://www.opendap.org/software/hyrax-data-server[Hyrax
download and installation page] and this guide for configuration
information.

Assuming that you have Hyrax installed and running on your local system
you should be able to quickly verify the WCS service is available by
pointing your browser at the default WCS endpoint
`http://localhost:8080/opendap/wcs` Which should return a browser
renderable HTML page of the _Capabilities_ document with a conspicuously
empty _Contents_
section.

== Configuration

Because WCS requires certain metadata to work (whereas DAP can
function with nothing more than a variable's name and type), our
service provides a way to use WCS with DAP datasets that natively lack
the required WCS metadata. We do this by creating mappings (DynamicService
instances) between collections of DAP datasets that have similar
domain coordinates and a WCS service for the resulting Coverages.
These relationships are expressed the _wcs_service.xml_ configuration
file, as a simple XML document.

----

<1> The _DynamicService_ creates a WCS by creating a link between DAP datasets
matching the regex and the WCS meta information provided in the DynamicService definition.
<2> *prefix*: This is a simple string used by the WcsCatalog implementation to
distinguish each DynamicService. Choosing a value that is in some way related to the
collection being serviced can be helpful to people if there are problems later.
<3> *name*: A human readable and meaningful name that will be used by the server when it
creates a link to the service in the _viewers_ page.
<4> *href*: The value of *href* controls which of two fundamental ways the DynamicService
will be used. One way utilizes the BES as the source of metadata and data for the
WCS service and the other utilizes a remote Hyrax server for the role. To use a local
BES, the value of the `href` variable must begin with `bes://` and must be followed by a
regular expression. The regular expression is used to determine which DAP datasets will be associated
with this DynamicService. In the example above the `href` attribute is set like this:

    href="bes://^/testbed-13/M2SDNXSLV\.5\.12\.4/.*$"

+
This value tells the server use the BES directly and to assocaiate this WCS definition with any DAP dataset
whose local path name on the server matches the regular expression

    `^/testbed-13/M2SDNXSLV\.5\.12\.4/.*$`

+
Which can be read as _"Anything that starts with `/testbed-13/M2SDNXSLV.5.12.4/` "_

<5> *srs*:  The _srs_ attribute defines the expected SRS for the coverages associated with this
DynamicService. The SRS defines the axis labels, order, units and
minimum number of domain coordinate dimensions and will be used for any dataset
that does not contain an explicit SRS definition. Currently only _urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326_ is
supported.


NOTE: Currently the only supported SRS is `urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326`

=== Domain Coordinate Definitions
The Hyrax WCS relies on the DynamicService definition to be
responsible for identifying the specific variables in the DAP datasets that are to be used for the geo-referenced domain coordinates of the coverage.
The domain coordinates must appear in the order that they appear in the dimensions of the DAP dataset. They must also match the order of axes represented in the SRS. _If there is an unresolvable conflict then until a suitable SRS can be identified the DAP dataset cannot be served as a Coverage._ Many DAP datasets have variables with more than two dimensions: latitude, longitude, elevation, and time are frequently seen as domain coordinates in scientific data. These can be utilized in the WCS as long as the inner most (last) two dimensions are in agreement with the SRS.

Let's consider the DomainCoordinate definitions from the example above:

[source,xml]
-----
<DomainCoordinate
    name="time"
    dapID="time"
    size="1"
    units="Days since 1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    min="690"
    max="690" />
<DomainCoordinate
    name="latitude"
    dapID="lat"
    size="361"
    units="deg"
    min="-90"
    max="90" />
<DomainCoordinate
    name="longitude"
    dapID="lon"
    size="576"
    units="deg"
    min="-180"
    max="180" />
-----

In our friend EPSG:4326 we know that the axis order is `latitude, longitude` and that's the order in the example. There is also an additional time coordinate which comes prior to the defintions for `latitude` and `longitude`.

Consider the `latitude` DomainCoordinate:

[source,xnl]
-----
<DomainCoordinate name="latitude" dapID="lat" size="361" units="deg" min="-90.0" max="90.0"/>
-----

This tells the service that the coordinate axis named `latitude` is
bound to the DAP variable `lat`, that a default value for _size_ as
361 elements, the default _units_ are degrees "deg", the default
minimum value is -90.0 and the default maximum value is 90.0. What
this means is that when the DynamicService processes a DAP dataset
into a coverage it will check the dataset's metadata for this tyoe of
information. If any of these values can be determined from the dataset
metadata then that value is used, otherwise the values expressed in
the DomainCoordinate definition are used.

Longitude and time are handled in the same way as latitude.


=== Providing Field defintions
Many DAP datasets either lack the metadata for determining which
variables will make suitable coverages, or the information may not be in an
expected form or location. In order to enable these datasets to be
exposed via WCS,  Hyrax allows the definition of a field in the
_DynamicService_ element.

NOTE: WCS Field names have limitations on the kinds of characters they
can contain. Specifically, these field names must be
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1631396/what-is-an-xsncname-type-and-when-should-it-be-used[NCNAMEs],
which means that they cannot contain special sysmbols such as @, $, %,
&, /, +, most punctuation, spaces, tabs, newlines or parentheses.
Furthermore, they cannot begin with a digit, dot (.) or minus (-)
although those can appear later in the name. Because DAP variables do
not have such a limitation, you may have to provide a new name for the
variable.

In the following _DynamicService_ definition, each variable in the
dataset is exposed as a WCS field and basic information required by
WCS is provided.

== Hyrax Integration

The integration of the WCS service into Hyrax is similar to that of the
xref:WMS_Service[WMS service] described elsewhere in this manual in that it
employs the concept of a DynamicService. However, unlike the ncWMS
software, the WCS-2 service is bundled with Hyrax (version 1.14 and
newer) so there is no addition installation step required once you
have Hyrax installed.

*WCS DynamicService*: A WCS DynamicService creates an association
between a URL path prefix in the WCS service path, and these crucial
things:

- A simple coverage template for a particular file, or collection of files,
with similar domain coordinate characteristics.
- The URL of either a DAP server from which to get the data, or a BES
protocol reference (``bes://``) that tells the WCS service that a direct
BES connection should be used to service the requests.
- If a BES protocol reference is provided then the rest of the href value
must be a regular expression which is applied to the dataset file
path in the server. At runtime when Hyrax uses the regex to determine if
a particular dataset should get WCS service links in it's _viewers_ page
and in its THREDDS catalog reference.

The DynamicService instances are defined in the _wcs_service.xml_ file.

In this WCS implementation there is no separate comprehensive
WCS service with a catalog containing all of the coverages that might
be found in the server. Instead, the Hyrax server's catalogs' _viewers_ pages are
used to access the WCS service interface for a particular dataset.
From a programmatic access perspective the WCS endpoint URLs are easily
constructed and appear as service links associated with datasets in
the THREDDS catalogs generated by the server.
