== Overview
This documentation describes the installation, configuration,
and operation of the _Hyrax Data server_, a data server that integrates
structured data with the world wide web. Hyrax is one example of a
number of data servers that implement OPeNDAP's Data Access Protocol (DAP).

//NOTE: TODO: Rewrite this text to be more about the sever's capabilities than how the software was implemented.
 
Hyrax uses the Java servlet mechanism to hand off requests from a
general web daemon to DAP format-specific software. This provides 
higher performance for small requests. The servlet front end, which we
call the **O**PeNDAP **L**ightweight **F**ront end **S**erver (OLFS)
looks at each request and formulates a query to a second server (which
may or may not on the same machine as the OLFS) called the **B**ack
**E**nd **S**erver (BES).

The BES is the high-performance server software from HAO. It reads data from the data stores and returning DAP-compliant responses to the OLFS. In turn, the OLFS may pass these response back to the
requestor with little or no modification or it may use them to build
more complex responses. The nature of the Inter Process Communication
(IPC) between the OLFS and BES is such that they should both be on the
same machine or be able to communicate over a very high bandwidth
channel.

The OLFS and the BES will run and serve test data immediately
after a default installation. Additional configuration is required for
them to serve site specific data.

== Features

THREDDS Catalog Support ::
  Hyrax supports the THREDDS catalogs. It can serve user supplied static
  catalogs and it will dynamically generate THREDDS catalogs of it's
  internal holdings.

Dataset Aggregation ::
  Collections of related data resources can be collected into a single
  dataset using the aggregation features. Typically these are formed for
  geographic tiles, time series, etc.

Adding/modifying dataset content. ::
  Datasets can be modified by the server without having to actually
  change the underlying files. These views are independently accessible
  from the original data. Both dataset metadata and data values may be
  added or changed.

Supports multiple source data formats ::
  Server can ingest source data stored as HDF4, HDF4-EOS, HDF5,
  HDF5-EOS, NetCDF-3, NetCDF-4, CEDAR, FITS, Comma Separated Values, and
  raw ASCII and Binary formats. Because of Hyrax's extensible design,
  it's easy to add new source data formats.

 Supports data retrieval in multiple return formats ::
  Hyrax is able to return data in DAP, DAP4, NetCDF-3, NetCDF-4, JSON,
  CSV, and ASCII formats, Or, you can add your own response types.

 Gateway ::
  Hyrax supports a gateway feature that allows it to provide DAP (and
  other Hyrax) services for remotely held datasets that are stored in
  any of Hyrax's source data formats.

 RDF ::
  Hyrax provides RDF descriptions of it's data holdings. These can
  enable semantic web tools to operate upon the metadata content held in
  the server.

 Server Side Functions ::
  Hyrax supports a number of link:./Server_Side_Processing_Functions.adoc[Server side
functions] out of the box
  including (but not limited to):
  
  * __link:./Server_Side_Processing_Functions.adoc#geogrid.28.29[geogrid]__:
  Subset applicable DAP Grids using latitude and longitude values.
  * __link:./Server_Side_Processing_Functions.adoc#grid.28.29[grid]__:
  Subset any DAP Grid object using the values of it's map vectors.
  * __link:./Server_Side_Processing_Functions#linear_scale.adoc[linear_scale]__:
  Apply a linear equation to the data returned, including automatic use
  of CF attributes.
  * __link:./Server_Side_Processing_Functions.adoc#version.28.29[version]__:
  The version function provides a list of the server-side processing
  functions available.
  * New ones are easy to add.

Extensible WebStart functionality for data clients ::
  Hyrax provides WebStart functionality for a number of Java based DAP
  clients. It's simple to add new clients to the list that Hyrax
  supports.

Extensible/Configurable web interface ::
  The web interface for both Hyrax and the administrator's interface can
  be customized using CSS and XSL. You can add your organizations logo
  and specialize the colors and fonts in the presentation of data sets.

Administrator's interface ::
  Control and dynamically update Hyrax from a convenient web interface.
  See link:./Hyrax_Administrators_Interface.adoc[the Admin
  interface documentation].

 WMS services ::
  link:./MAster-Hyrax_WMS.adoc[Hyrax now supports WMS services via
  integration with ncWMS.]

 JSON responses ::
  link:./Hyrax_JSON.adoc[Both metadata and data are now available
  in a JSON encoding.]

 w10n ::
  Hyrax comes with a complete w10n service stack. W10n navigation is
  supported through the default catalog where all datasets and
  "structure" variables appear as graph nodes. Data can be acquired for
  atomic types or arrays of atomic types in a number of formats.

Feature Request ::
  Is there a feature you would like to see but don't? Let us know:
  support@opendap.org or opendap-tech@opendap.org (You need to
  http://mailman.opendap.org/mailman/listinfo/opendap-tech[subscribe]
  first)

== Downloading and Installation

The download and installation instructions are kept together. For the
latest release look at https://www.opendap.org/software/hyrax-data-server[the Hyrax
downloads page].

If you are interested in working on Hyrax or just want to build the
server from source code (as opposed to using the prebuilt binaries we
provide, you can get signed source distributions from the
https://www.opendap.org/software/hyrax-data-server[download page]
referenced above. See also the <<for-developers, For Software
Developers>> section below.

== Modules

Hyrax has a number of modules that provide the actual functionality of
the server: Reading data files, building different kinds of responses
and performing different kinds of server processing operations. Most of
these modules work with the BES but some are part of the front (web
facing) part of the server.

* link:../index.php/How_to_use_Eclipse_with_Hyrax_Source_Code[How to use
Eclipse with Hyrax Source Code] Note that this is a a work in progress,
but it will help with some of the odd steps that Eclipse seems to
require.

==== BES Development Information
